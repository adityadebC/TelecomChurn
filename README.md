# TelecomChurn

This project looks into a Telecom Dataset and try to predict which users are most likely to leave the network.
The data isnt balanced as in, the number of samples for people who left is far less than that which didnt leave.
So my goal is to increase Recall rather than accuracy. We can deal with lesser Precison if need be(It is better to give incentives to 2 customers who isn't going to leave rather than have 1 customer leave :D )
